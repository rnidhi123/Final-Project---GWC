            <h1> Hi, I'm Nidhi. </h1>
            <p> I'm 12 years old and in 6th grade.</p>
            <p> I recently discovered that coding is one of my passions. I am learning Java and I'm a member of my school's Girls Who Code club. </p>
            <p> I love to learn, especially when I can create something that I can call my own, like this website. Learning is very important to me, and I enjoy learning new things.</p>
            <p> I have been coding for more than a year, and a lot of people have inspired and guided me. </p>
            <p> This website is all about who I am. Explore this website to learn about me. </p>

            <h1> My Coding Experience</h1>
            <h3> Scratch and Tynker</h3>
            <p> I first started coding with Scratch and Tynker (the ones where you drag and drop blocks to form the code) in elementary school. In my free time, I used Scratch to animate characters through code. When I was in the computer lab, I would sometimes use Tynker's Hour of Code program and create mini-games.</p>
            <p> I did not find coding interesting in 5th grade. In fact, I found it a little boring. Why? I thought that dragging and dropping blocks was easy, and that I needed a bigger challenge. But at that time, I didn't know that actual coding was more complex, and did I not think much of coding.</p>
            <p> In 6th grade, one of my classes was Tynker. I thought that maybe it deserved a second chance, and I found out that it really did. I gained so much more knowledge in the world of code, and I was proud of the projects that I made.</p>
            <h3> Java Classes</h3>
            <p> Now I had become really interested in code, and I hungered for more. One day, my mom asked me if I wanted to join Java classes, and I immediately agreed. I was extremely thrilled for my first class. I started created wonderful games using Java, which turned out to be a more complicated language than I previously thought. I always enjoy going to my Java classes.</p>
            <h3> Girls Who Code</h3>
            <p> By now, I loved code. I also got the opportunity to become a member of my school's Girls Who Code club, which is where I created this website. I learned many languages here, including CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I really could understand coding by now, and knew how to create my own projects. I could have never loved coding more than I do now.</p>

        <div id="tab3" class="tab">
            <h1> About Me</h1>
            <p> I live with my mom and my dad, and I have a sister in college. I live in a neighborhood where there are a lot of people my age, so in my free time, you probably won't find me at home. I go to dance class once a week, and I help my dance teacher with her batch of little kids. I like to play badminton a lot, and I hope to get really good at it. I sometimes do arts and crafts at home as well. </p>

            <p> I really adore baby hedgehogs because they are so cute! The pictures above are my favorite pictures of baby hedgehogs that I have ever seen.</p>

            <h1>Dedication</h1>
            <h3>My Parents</h3>
            <p> I would like to thank my parents for all their love and support. Without their enthusiasm and support, I probably would not love coding as much as I do now. Love you guys!</p>
            <h3>My Instructors</h3>
            <p> I would also like to thank all of the Girls Who Code instructors for helping me with the issues and making sure that my website is exactly the way I want it. Thank you!</p>
