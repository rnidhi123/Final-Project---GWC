            <h1> Hi, I'm Nidhi. </h1>
            <p> I'm 12 years old and in 6th grade.</p>
            <p> I recently discovered that coding is one of my passions. I am learning Java and I'm a member of my school's Girls Who Code club. </p>
            <p> I love to learn, especially when I can create something that I can call my own, like this website. Learning is very important to me, and I enjoy learning new things.</p>
            <p> I have been coding for more than a year, and a lot of people have inspired and guided me. </p>
            <p> This website is all about who I am. Explore this website to learn about me. </p>

            <h1> My Coding Experience</h1>
            <h3> Scratch and Tynker</h3>
            <p> I first started coding with Scratch and Tynker (the ones where you drag and drop blocks to form the code) in elementary school. In my free time, I used Scratch to animate characters through code. When I was in the computer lab, I would sometimes use Tynker's Hour of Code program and create mini-games.</p>
            <p> I did not find coding interesting in 5th grade. In fact, I found it a little boring. Why? I didn't know how to use blocks to form code, so I had a hard time creating projects, so I found coding boring. But at that time, I didn't know that actual coding was more complex.</p>
            <p> In 6th grade, one of my classes was Tynker. I thought that maybe it deserved a second chance, and it was actually really fun and interesting. I gained so much more knowledge about code, and I was proud of my creations.</p>
            <h3> Java Classes</h3>
            <p> Now I found coding enjoyable, and I wanted to learn more. One day, my mom asked me if I wanted to join Java classes, and I immediately agreed. I started created fun games using Java, which turned out to be a more complicated language than I previously thought. I always enjoy going to my Java classes.</p>
            <h3> Girls Who Code</h3>
            <p> By now, I loved coding. I also got the opportunity to become a member of my school's Girls Who Code club, which is where I created this website. I learned many languages here, including HTML, Javascript, and CSS. I could understand code very well by now, and knew how to create my own projects. Being in this club was a really fun and memorable experience.</p>

            <h1> About Me</h1>
            <h3>At Home</h3>
            <p> I live with my mom and dad, and I have an older sister in college. A lot of my friends live in the same neighborhood as me, so many times, I'll be playing outside with them.</p>
            <h3>My Interests</h3>
            <p> Aside from coding, I like to play badminton. I go to badminton classes, and I hope to get really good at it. I also like to do arts and crafts at home in my spare time.</p>
            <h3>Dance</h3>
            <p> I've been dancing since I was 7, and my first performance was when I was 4. My group and I have given many dance performances, and we've won several prizes in competitions. I also help my teacher with her beginner group of students. I help them with their steps and skills, and I also keep track of their progress. I am really passionate about dancing.</p>
            <h3> What 'Cute' Really Means</h3>

            <p> I really adore baby hedgehogs because they are so cute! The pictures above are my favorite pictures of baby hedgehogs that I have ever seen.</p>

            <h1>Dedication</h1>
            <h3>My Parents</h3>
            <p> I would like to thank my parents for all their love and support. Without them constantly encouraging me to do my best, I would probably not like coding as much as I do now. Love you guys!</p>
            <h3>My Instructors</h3>
            <p> I would also like to thank all of the Girls Who Code instructors for helping me with the technical issues while creating this website and making sure that it is exactly the way I want it. Thank you!</p>
