            <h1> Hi, I'm Nidhi. </h1>
            <p> I'm 12 years old and in 6th grade.</p>
            <p> I recently discovered that coding is one of my passions. I am learning Java and I'm a member of my school's Girls Who Code club. </p>
            <p> I love to learn, especially when I can create something that I can call my own, like this website. Learning is very important to me, and I enjoy learning new things.</p>
            <p> I have been coding for more than a year, and a lot of people have inspired and guided me. </p>
            <p> This website is all about who I am. Explore this website to learn about me. </p>

            <h1> My Coding Experience</h1>
            <h3> Scratch and Tynker</h3>
            <p> I first started coding with Scratch and Tynker (the ones where you drag and drop blocks to form the code) in 5th grade. In our free time, we got to code on Scratch. When we went to the computer lab, we would sometimes do Tynker's Hour of Code.</p>
            <p> I did not find coding interesting in 5th grade. In fact, I found it a little boring. Why? I thought that dragging and dropping blocks was easy, and that I needed a bigger challenge. But at that age, I didn't know that actual coding was more complex, and did not think much of coding.</p>
            <p> In one of my 6th grade classes, I got Tynker. I thought that maybe it deserved a second chance, and I'm glad I gave it one. I gained so much more knowledge in the world of code, and I was proud of my creations.</p>
            <h3> Java Classes</h3>
            <p> Now I had become really interested in code, and I hungered for more. One day, my mom asked me if I wanted to join Java classes, and I immediately said yes. I started created wonderful games using Java, which turned out to be a more complicated language than I previously thought. I enjoyed and still enjoy every single one of my classes.</p>
            <h3> Girls Who Code</h3>
            <p> By now, I loved code. I also got the opportunity to join my school's Girls Who Code club. That is where I created this website. I learned many languages here, including CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I really could understand coding by now, and knew how to create my own projects. I could have never loved coding more than I do now.</p>

            <h1> About Me</h1>
            <p> I'm 12 years old and I'm in 6th grade. I live in a neighborhood where there are a lot of people my age, so in my free time, you probably won't find me at home. I go to dance class once a week, and I help my dance teacher with her batch of little kids. I like to play badminton a lot, and I hope to get really good at it. I sometimes do arts and crafts at home as well. </p>

            <p> I really adore baby hedgehogs because they are so cute! The pictures above are my favorite pictures of baby hedgehogs that I have ever seen.</p>

            <h1>Dedication</h1>
            <h3>My Parents</h3>
            <p> I would like to thank my parents for all their love and support. Without their enthusiasm and support, I probably would not love coding as much as I do now. Love you guys!</p>
            <h3>My Instructors</h3>
            <p> I would also like to thank all of the people that taught me how to code so I could create this website. I want to thank Andy K. for helping me with all the technical difficulties while creating this website. I also want to give a shoutout to Mrs. Reed, Parmita, Pratibha, Shivanee, and Eshani for helping me create this website the way I wanted it from the beginning. Thank you!</p>
